## Tauri Version
> More information may be coming soon...
 
### Update Two:
Although not nearly as many as the major version update, the _beta_ bump of Tauri has quite a few breaking changes when migrating from _alpha_. The _alpha_ verision mentioned below can be obtained from [this commit](712ee15dd38d843b9256ea56bf1683e4614c700c) if desired.

### Update One:

Since the version is still in alpha it may have more bugs than the stable version `1.x.x`
It is recommended to try out both branches to discern which works best for your current application needs.
If you would prefer working with that one then there is a [_bare bones commit_](https://github.com/DownQuark-Work/downquark.templateNative.ApplicationTauri/commit/6564fee031b9b270ce200a99310091d422b316db) as well as a more [_feature rich commit_](https://github.com/DownQuark-Work/downquark.templateNative.ApplicationTauri/commit/2c2faf5205b48e0d326e72cca984b33c13be67d6) you may wish to utilize.
