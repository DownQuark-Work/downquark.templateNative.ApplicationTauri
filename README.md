# Tauri Application
> A dq template
 
Both `main` and `develop` branches contains the alpha version `2.x.x` of **[Tauri](https://tauri.app)**.

## Tauri Version
 
Since the version is still in alpha it may have more bugs than the stable version `1.x.x`
It is recommended to try out both branches to discern which works best for your current application needs.
If you would prefer working with that one then there is a [_bare bones commit_](https://github.com/DownQuark-Work/downquark.templateNative.ApplicationTauri/commit/6564fee031b9b270ce200a99310091d422b316db) as well as a more [_feature rich commit_](https://github.com/DownQuark-Work/downquark.templateNative.ApplicationTauri/commit/2c2faf5205b48e0d326e72cca984b33c13be67d6) you may wish to utilize.
 
More information may be coming soon...
