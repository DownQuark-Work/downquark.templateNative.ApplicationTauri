# Tauri Application
> A dq template

The `main` branch contains the _Bare Bones_ implementation to get off the ground running.

The `develop` branch is more robust.

It is recommended to try out both branches to discern which works best for your current application needs.
- If `develop`, simply merge it into `main`
- If `main`, switch to develop and run: `% git reset --hard HEAD~1`

More information will be coming soon...
